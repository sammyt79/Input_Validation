# Input_Validation

.NET2 week4

This was my week 4 individual assignment for .NET2 C#.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Design, implement, test, and debug a C# program to demonstrate input validation using regular expression.  The program should validate at least one type of data - you are free to choose a commonly used data format such as Social Security Number (999-9999-99), or phone number (999-999-9999), or a custom format that you designed.
